    "    1. Define the problem\n",
    "        Farmers are unable to detect diseases on their crops by just looking at them. This\n",
    "        leads to damages that costs them lots of money. Our solution is to use captured\n",
    "        photos of crops to tell whether or not they are diseased and if diseased, tell the\n",
    "        particular disease affecting the plant. The farmer can then purchase the right \n",
    "        medicine for their plants.\n",
    "    2. How will the solution be used? \n",
    "        To determine the health level of crops in farms, allowing farmers to take necessary\n",
    "        actions i.e apply pesticicides or insecticides\n",
    "    3. What are the current solutions?\n",
    "        Eye balling crops to determine whether or not they are infected.\n",
    "        Watching out for insects or pests that are associated with a certain disease\n",

    "    6. Is perfomance measure aligned with our objective?\n",
    "        Objective is to determine whether or not a plant has a particular.\n",
    "    7. What would be the minimum perfomance needed to achieve our objective?\n",
    "        Compare to human accuracy.\n",
    "    8. What are comparable problems?\n",
    "    9. Is human expertise available?\n",
    "        Nope, used Google\n",

    "            The plants suffer from a single disease\n",
    "            The disease manifests its symptoms on the leaves.\n",
    "            The farmer is able to acquire high quality photos that can be used by the \n",
